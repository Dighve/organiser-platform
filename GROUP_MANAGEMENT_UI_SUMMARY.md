# Group Management UI Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete group-centric workflow for the Organiser Platform. Users can now create groups, browse and join public groups, manage their group memberships, and create events within their groups. The navigation has been updated to prioritize groups over individual events.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. My Groups Page (`/groups`)
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/MyGroupsPage.jsx`

**Features**:
- Displays all groups the user has subscribed to
- Shows group details: name, activity type, member count, location, and organiser
- **Create Event** button on each group card - navigates to event creation with `groupId` parameter
- **Leave Group** button with confirmation dialog
- Navigation buttons to Browse Groups and Create Group
- Empty state with call-to-action to browse groups
- Real-time updates using React Query mutations
- Authentication check - redirects unauthenticated users

**UI Elements**:

- Group status badges (Active/Inactive)
- Member count display
- Activity type tags
- Location information

### 2. Browse Groups Page (`/groups/browse`)
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/BrowseGroupsPage.jsx`

**Features**:
- Displays all public groups available to join
- **Search functionality** - filter groups by name, description, or activity
- **Subscribe/Join Group** button on each group card
- No authentication required to view (accessible to all users)
- Prompts login when attempting to join a group while unauthenticated
- Shows detailed group information
- Navigation to My Groups and Create Group
- Empty state messaging

**UI Elements**:
- Search bar with icon
- Public/Private badges
- Activity type highlighting
- Member count and max member limits
- Organiser information
- Responsive grid layout

### 3. Create Group Page (`/groups/create`)
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/CreateGroupPage.jsx`

**Features**:
- Comprehensive form for creating new groups
- **Dynamic activity type dropdown** - fetches from backend
- Form validation with error messages
- All fields supported:
  - Group name (required)
  - Activity type selection (required)
  - Description
  - Location
  - Maximum members (optional)
  - Public/Private toggle
- Authentication required
- Success/error handling with user feedback
- Cancel button to return to My Groups

**UI Elements**:
- Clean form layout with labels
- Required field indicators
- Validation error messages
- Checkbox for public visibility
- Submit and cancel buttons

### 4. Updated Create Event Page
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/CreateEventPage.jsx`

**Changes Made**:
- ‚úÖ Accepts `groupId` from URL query parameters
- ‚úÖ Associates created event with the specified group
- ‚úÖ Dynamic title: "Create Event for Group" when groupId present
- ‚úÖ Dynamic activity dropdown (replaced manual input with API-fetched activities)
- ‚úÖ Navigates back to groups page after successful creation (when created from group)
- ‚úÖ Fixed field name: changed `price` to `cost` to match backend DTO
- ‚úÖ Integrated with `eventsAPI.createEvent()` instead of raw fetch

**Usage**:
- From My Groups page: Click "Create Event" ‚Üí redirects to `/create-event?groupId=123`
- Standalone: Navigate to `/create-event` ‚Üí creates event without group association

### 5. Updated Navigation (Header)
**File**: `frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx`

**Changes**:
- ‚ùå **Removed**: "Create Event" link from header
- ‚ùå **Removed**: "My Events" link from header
- ‚úÖ **Added**: "My Groups" link (navigates to `/groups`)
- ‚úÖ **Added**: "Browse Groups" link (navigates to `/groups/browse`)
- Updated footer quick links to prioritize groups
- Changed icons from Calendar/Plus to Users icon

**Rationale**: Events are now created within the context of groups, so direct event creation from the header is no longer the primary workflow.

### 6. Updated Routes
**File**: `frontend/src/App.jsx`

**New Routes Added**:
```javascript
/groups                 ‚Üí MyGroupsPage (Private)
/groups/browse          ‚Üí BrowseGroupsPage (Public)
/groups/create          ‚Üí CreateGroupPage (Private)
```

```javascript
/create-event          ‚Üí CreateEventPage (Private)
/my-events             ‚Üí MyEventsPage (Private)
```

### 7. Updated Home Page
