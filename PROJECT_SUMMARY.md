## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Core Entities

1. **User**
   - Authentication & profile information
   - Roles: MEMBER, ORGANISER, ADMIN
   - Relationships: organised events, participating events, reviews

2. **Event**
   - Event details (title, description, location)
   - Activity-specific fields (difficulty, distance, elevation)
   - Participant management
   - Status tracking (DRAFT, PUBLISHED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED, FULL)

3. **ActivityType**
   - Extensible activity categories
   - Activity-specific requirements
   - Currently supports: Hiking (extensible to cycling, camping, etc.)

4. **Review**
   - Event ratings and feedback
   - User reviews for completed events

## 🔐 Security Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth
- **Password Encryption**: BCrypt hashing
- **Role-Based Access Control**: MEMBER, ORGANISER, ADMIN roles
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for frontend
- **Security Headers**: XSS protection, frame options, etc.

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### 1. Local Development (Docker Compose)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Backend, Frontend all running locally
- Ideal for development and testing

### 2. Kubernetes (Production)
```bash
./deploy.sh
```
- Supports AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS
- Auto-scaling configured (2-10 pods)
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Persistent storage for database

### 3. Cloud Platforms
- **AWS**: EKS + RDS + ElastiCache
- **Google Cloud**: GKE + Cloud SQL + Memorystore
- **Azure**: AKS + Azure Database + Azure Cache

## 💰 Cost Optimization

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly, 100K users)

**AWS**:
- RDS PostgreSQL: $60
- ElastiCache Redis: $15
- EKS: $73
- EC2 (spot instances): $30
- S3 + Transfer: $22
- **Total: ~$200/month**

**Google Cloud**:
- Cloud SQL: $25
- Memorystore: $30
- GKE: $75
- Compute (preemptible): $25
- Storage: $2
- **Total: ~$157/month**

### Cost-Saving Strategies
1. Use spot/preemptible instances (70% savings)
2. Implement aggressive caching (Redis)
3. Connection pooling (HikariCP)
4. Auto-scaling (scale down during low traffic)
5. CDN for static assets
6. Image compression and optimization
