# Notification System - Quick Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

A comprehensive notification system has been implemented for the OutMeets platform.

## 🎯 What Users See

1. **Bell Icon** in header (top right, before user dropdown)
2. **Badge Count** showing unread notifications (orange-pink gradient)
3. **Dropdown Panel** with recent notifications (click bell to open)
4. **Click Notifications** to navigate to related events
5. **Mark as Read** - Individual or all at once
6. **Auto-Refresh** - Unread count updates every 30 seconds

## 📬 Notification Types

### Currently Implemented:
1. **New Event** - When an event is published in a subscribed group
2. **New Comment** - When someone comments on an event you're attending

### Future Types:
- Reply to your comment
- Event updates
- Event cancellations
- Event reminders (24h before)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend (Java Spring Boot)
- **Database Table**: `notifications` with indexes
- **Entity**: `Notification.java`
- **Repository**: `NotificationRepository.java`
- **Service**: `NotificationService.java`
- **Controller**: `NotificationController.java`
- **Triggers**: EventService (publish), EventCommentService (comment)

### Frontend (React)
- **Component**: `NotificationBell.jsx`
- **API**: `notificationsAPI` in `api.js`
- **Integration**: Added to `Layout.jsx` header

## 📡 API Endpoints

```
GET    /api/v1/notifications                 - Get notifications (paginated)
GET    /api/v1/notifications/unread-count    - Get unread count
PUT    /api/v1/notifications/{id}/read       - Mark as read
PUT    /api/v1/notifications/read-all        - Mark all as read
DELETE /api/v1/notifications/{id}            - Delete notification
```

## 🎨 Design

- **Colors**: Purple-pink-orange gradients (OutMeets brand)
- **Badge**: Orange-pink gradient with white text
- **Icons**: Bell icon from lucide-react
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and hover effects
- **Empty State**: Friendly message when no notifications

## 🚀 How It Works

### New Event Flow:
1. Organiser publishes event
2. System creates notifications for all group subscribers (except organiser)
3. Members see unread count increase
4. Click bell → see notification
5. Click notification → navigate to event
6. Notification marked as read

### New Comment Flow:
1. User posts comment on event
2. System creates notifications for all event participants (except commenter)
3. Participants see unread count increase
4. Click bell → see notification with comment preview
5. Click notification → navigate to event
6. Notification marked as read

## 🔒 Security

- JWT authentication required
- Users only see their own notifications
- Authorization checks on all endpoints
- Cascade delete when related entities removed

## ⚡ Performance

- Pagination (20 per page)
- React Query caching (30 seconds)
- Database indexes for fast queries
- Lazy loading (only fetch when dropdown opens)
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

## 📋 Testing Checklist
