## 🎯 Quick Decision: Which Option?

### You Said: "Don't want to pay too much money"

**My Recommendation: Render + Netlify (100% FREE)** 🏆

- **Cost**: $0/month
- **Setup Time**: 30 minutes
- **User Capacity**: 5-50 light users
- **Trade-off**: 30-second cold start after 15 min inactivity

### Alternative: Railway ($5-8/month)
- **Better UX**: No cold starts
- **Simpler**: Everything in one place
- **Cost**: Uses $5 free monthly credit, may need $3-8 extra

## 📈 Scaling Path

As your POC grows:

### 10-50 users (Current Setup)
- **Cost**: $0/month
- **Platform**: Render + Netlify free tier
- **Performance**: Acceptable with cold starts

### 50-500 users ($7-20/month)
- Upgrade Render to Starter plan ($7/month)
- Keep Netlify free tier
- No cold starts, better performance

### 500-5000 users ($50-100/month)
- Render Professional ($20/month)
- Netlify Pro ($19/month)
- Larger database ($10-30/month)
- CDN optimization

### 5000+ users ($200+/month)
- Consider AWS/GCP/Azure
- Kubernetes deployment
- Professional DevOps setup
- Database optimization

**For POC**: Free tier is perfect! 🎯
