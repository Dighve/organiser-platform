## 🎯 My Strong Recommendation for Your POC

### Go with **Render + Netlify**

**Why?**
1. ✅ You explicitly said "don't want to pay too much"
2. ✅ POC with "few people" = perfect for free tier
3. ✅ $0/month is hard to beat
4. ✅ 30-minute setup is reasonable
5. ✅ Easy to upgrade later if needed

**The cold start issue is manageable:**
- Most POCs aren't used 24/7
- 30s wait once every 15 min is acceptable for testing
- Can upgrade to $7/month later for always-on

**If $5-8/month is acceptable:**
- Go with **Railway** instead
- Better experience
- No cold starts
- Simpler monitoring
